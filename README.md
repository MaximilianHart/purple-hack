# Purple Hack
> *A fair-use amalgamation of OD&D (Attributes, Combat, & Cleric Spell Progression - ref. Swords & Wizardry), AD&amp;D 1e (Spells & Classes - ref. OSRIC), AD&D 2e (Thief - ref. For Gold & Glory), B/X (Procedures - ref. Old-School Essentials) and other RPGs into a single ruleset for personal use. The design goal is to combine some meaningful character creation choices from AD&D/OSRIC with the class descriptions, unified saving throw & quick combat of Swords & Wizardry, plus some procedures from B/X and some other sources that I enjoy. Much of this is copied & pasted from the above sources; this is not intended to be original work, but a tribute & home game "house rules" set. Please don't sue me. :grimacing:*

## Roll Quick Equipment
**(Or roll 3d6*10sp and go shopping!)**

*We're using "item slot" encumbrance. Most things are 1 slot, but 2h weapons and medium armor are 2, heavy armor is 3, and coins & gems stack to 500 in a slot. If you cross the line marked on your character sheet, you're encumbered.*

- You start with: a backpack, tinderbox, waterskin, rations x3, torches x3, 3d6sp.
- Armor based on class. Magic-Users have no armor or shield (but get 4d6sp). Thief & Druid get leather armor. Others roll 1d6:
  - 1-2=Leather (AC 12)
  - 3-4=Ring (AC 13)
  - 5=Scale (AC 14)
  - 6=Chainmail (AC 15)
- Choose a weapon option (Clerics can only wield blunt weapons; Druids only wooden; Magic-Users only daggers, staves & darts; dwarves & halflings can't use large two-handed weapons):
  - Option A: One melee weapon & a shield (+1 AC)
  - Option B: One two-handed weapon (+1 damage)
  - Option C: Two one-handed weapons (+1 to hit)
  - Option D: One melee weapon & one ranged weapon (plus ammo)
- Roll 1d12 twice on the gear table below.
- Go shopping with your 3d6sp, if you want.
  - If you're a cleric, be sure to buy a holy symbol!
  - Make a note on your sheet which slots belong to which containers you have (backpack, sacks, etc.). Small sacks require one hand to carry, large sacks require two hands.

## Adventuring Gear Table

| 1d12 | Gear                          | 1d12 | Gear                          |
|------|-------------------------------|------|-------------------------------|
| 1    | Crowbar                       | 7    | 50' rope                     |
| 2    | Hammer (small) + iron spikes x12 | 8    | 50' rope + Grappling hook    |
| 3    | Holy water                    | 9    | Twine (100' ball)            |
| 4    | Lantern + Oil flask x3        | 10   | Vial, glass x3               |
| 5    | Hand mirror                   | 11   | Mallet + stakes x3           |
| 6    | Pole, 10'                     | 12   | Wolfsbane sprig              |

## Note Your XP Bonus (If Any)

+5% XP (cumulative) bonus for each of the following: Prime Attribute(s) 13+, Wis 13+, Cha 13+.

## Note Your Movement Speed

The first number is your exploration speed, the second is your speed in combat.

| Armor Worn               | Unencumbered   | Encumbered     |
|--------------------------|----------------|----------------|
| Unarmored, Leather       | 120' (40')     | 90' (30')      |
| Ring, Scale, Chainmail   | 90' (30')      | 60' (20')      |
| Splint, Plate            | 60' (20')      | 30' (10')      |


## Check Any Special Abilities You Have

- **Alertness**: A party with a Ranger is unlikely to be surprised, with only a 1-in-6 chance. A ranger surprises on 3-in-6.
- **Backstab**: When attacking with surprise from behind, the Thief gains +4 to hit and inflicts double damage.
- **Cure Disease**: A Paladin can cure disease by touch once per week (more often at higher levels) and is immune to disease.
- **Detect Evil**: A Paladin may detect evil at any range up to 60', provided he or she concentrates on doing so in the right general direction.
- **Fighting the Unskilled**: Against creatures with 1 hit die or less, a Fighter makes one attack per level each round.
- **Lay on Hands**: A Paladin can "lay on hands" once per day to cure 2hp per Paladin level.
- **Lone Ranger**: Until 8<sup>th</sup> Level & the title "Ranger Knight," a Ranger may not hire or accept followers of any kind. A maximum of three rangers may travel or operate together at any one time. Rangers travel light and may not keep more treasure than they (or their steed) can carry.
- **Paladin Vows**: Paladins may own 1 suit of magic armor, 1 magic shield, and up to 3 magic weapons, but no more than 4 additional magic items. Paladins must give away 10% of any treasure received to some Lawful Good cause, and if any remains after paying costs (like maintaining equipment or paying servants' wages), that surplus must likewise be donated. Paladins will not associate with characters who are not Lawful save under very exceptional circumstances.
- **Parry**: Fighters with a Dexterity score of 14 or better can parry instead of attacking to penalize incoming attacks at the following rate: Dex 14-15=-1 to hit, Dex 16-17=-2 to hit, Dex 18=-3 to hit.
- **Protection from Evil**: A Paladin radiates an aura within a 10' radius, equivalent to the clerical spell *protection from evil*.
- **Thieving Skills**: You're preternaturally good at some things. Roll the number listed or lower on 1d20 to succeed. At 1<sup>st</sup> level, you have 12 points to add to your skills (no more than 6 to one single skill). You'll also add your Dex mod to * skills. If you wear armor other than padded or leather while attempting the * skills or Climb Walls, you have a penalty equal to the number of slots the armor takes. Note: These Thieving Skills are also modified by your race.
  -   *Pick Pockets: 3
  -   *Open Locks: 2
  -   *Find/Remove Traps: 1
  -   *Move Silently: 2
  -   *Hide in Shadows: 1
  -   Climb Walls: 12
  -   Detect Noise: 3
  -   Read Languages: 0
- **Tracking**: Rangers are able to track other creatures, with a base chance of 90% (modifiers in full rules).
- **Turn Undead**: Clerics present their holy symbol in an attempt to "turn" the undead, causing the foul monsters to flee. Higher-level chaotic clerics may choose to control the undead instead of turning them. Roll 1d20, and if the number is equal to or greater than the number below, 2d6 creatures of the targeted type are turned and depart, not returning for 3d4 rounds: Skeleton (10), Zombie (13), Ghoul (16), Shadow (19), Wight (20).

## If You're A Magic-User, Roll for Spells

Read Magic & Detect Magic will always be your first spells; the rest will be random. See the list at right. At level 1, you can memorize one of your spells each day to cast. Also, add a spellbook to your inventory.

| Int     | Starting Spells   | Int     | Starting Spells   |
|---------|-------------------|---------|-------------------|
| 3-8     | 2                 | 15-16   | 5                 |
| 9-12    | 3                 | 17      | 6                 |
| 13-14   | 4                 | 18      | 7                 |

## Magic-User 1<sup>st</sup> Level Starting Spells

Note that you can learn many more spells than this! These are just the "basics" any self-respecting Magic-User might be expected to know.

1. **Charm Person.** Target thinks you're their bestie and might do what you say. Lasts longer vs dumb targets.
2. **Detect Magic.** You see nearby enchanted stuff glow for 2 minutes/level.
3. **Hold Portal**: Keep a door closed for 2 minutes/level.
4. **Light**: 20' radius light cast on an object or eyeballs (it'll blind a baddie!). Lasts 10 min per level.
5. **Magic Missile**: Auto-hit for 1d4+1 damage. More missiles as you level.
6. **Protection from Evil**: Against creatures of another alignment, you get +2 to saving throws and they get -2 to attack you for 2 minutes/level. Summoned & conjured creatures can't touch you.
7. **Read Languages**: You can read 2 things written in any language.
8. **Read Magic**: For 2 minutes/level, you can read magical scrolls, spellbooks, & inscriptions not written by you. Once you've read something once, you can read it again without recasting this spell.
9. **Shield**: A frontal shield that gives you +1 on saving throws vs frontal attacks, AC 18 vs thrown weapons, AC 17 vs missiles, and AC 16 vs other attacks. *Magic missiles* can't penetrate it.
10. **Sleep**: Magically puts creatures to sleep in a 15' radius. You'll want to read the actual description for this one.

*Rate of fire is the number of times that a missile weapon can be fired during a single combat round. Longbows and shortbows can be fired two times during a combat round, while a heavy crossbow can be fired only once in a round and must then be reloaded for a full round before it can be fired again.

†Shooting or throwing beyond this range is at a -2 penalty to hit. The weapon cannot reach farther than twice this range. Outdoors, these range increments are tripled.

# How to Play

## Dungeon Exploration

Many D&D adventures will involve the characters exploring some enclosed area, be it the dungeons beneath a castle or temple, a system of natural caves and caverns, an abandoned mine, the sewers beneath a city, an enemy fortress, a wizard's tower, or a shrine to some dark god. For convenience, and by tradition, these enclosed locations are collectively called "dungeons", which thus refers not just to a set of man-made tunnels but to any indoor adventure location. Indoor/dungeon adventures tend to have similar characteristics and thus the same set of procedures and suggested resolution mechanics applies to most "dungeon" adventures. Some terms to know:

### Movement During Dungeon Exploration

Is at the per-turn rate on your character sheet (the first, large number), and the party is limited to the speed of its slowest member. This slow, cautious move rate allows characters to make a map of their progress, observe their surroundings, hear monsters approaching, and have a chance to surprise them. When passing through familiar areas or following a map, characters can move at up to three times the normal per-turn move rate. Characters fleeing from an encounter may run at ten times their normal per-turn move rate. No mapping is possible while fleeing in this manner, the characters are automatically surprised by any monsters, and the party must rest for a turn at the end of the pursuit.

### Marching Order 

The players should establish the party's "marching order," i.e. which characters are in front, bringing up the rear, and in the middle. In a standard 10' wide dungeon corridor, up to three characters may walk abreast, depending on the weapons they're carrying (see Combat: Spacing & the Second Rank).

### Wandering Monster Checks

Every third turn (see "Time") (usually), the referee rolls to see if any wandering monsters are encountered (typically a 1-in-6 chance). Excessive noise (like smashing in a door) can lead to additional checks.

### Listening at Doors

PCs can strain in utter silence to hear anything beyond a closed door (or down a hallway). The base chance is 1-in-6, though elves and halflings have a 2-in-6 chance, and Thieves can have much higher chances. To listen intently takes a turn.

### Open a Stuck or Locked Door

Upon discovering that a door is stuck, a character may make an open doors check to pull the door open as swiftly and quietly as possible. Each character may only try once. On a failure, the party may decide to work with crowbars or other tools to wrench the door open anyway. This takes a turn and will trigger a wandering monster check. Locked doors need keys, Thieves' tools and a Thief, or a battering ram (or axes). Any failed attempt to open a stuck or locked door will prevent surprise on any creature on the other side of the door. You should also know: Doors tend to close on their own. Iron spikes are invaluable for keeping doors open or closed.

### Mapping

Maps are usually best made simply: boxes and lines are sufficient to keep you from getting lost. The players' map represents an actual in-game object. If the players at the table are making a map, then a character must also be making one. This has several corollaries: the party must have light (they can only map what they see) and mapping supplies (something to write with and something to write on), they must be moving slowly and methodically (no more than standard exploration speed), and measuring the size of a room takes time. Perhaps most importantly, if something happens to the map in-game, it happens to the players' map as well! If the mapping character dies and his or her body is left behind, if the characters are captured and stripped of their equipment, or if a jet of acid or a green slime destroys the map, the referee should confiscate it. If the party wants backup copies, the players must actually draw them. If the entire party dies in the dungeon, the only way their maps will survive is if copies were left on the surface.

### Search for Traps or Secret Doors

It's usually best to do this free-form and narratively (tell the referee what you're doing to search). A careful examination of a 10'x10' area or 10' section of wall takes one turn. Multiple characters can search/examine different areas simultaneously. There's a 2-in-6 standard chance of success (4-in-6 for elves and half-elves). Traps neither avoided nor disarmed have a 2-in-6 chance of triggering on interaction by a character.

### The Party Caller

If there are many players in the party, some groups like to designate one player as "Caller," or party spokesperson, and filter communication through that single player. This role should not default to a "party leader" who gives the other players orders and reduces them to spectators! Rather, some groups may find that by having a single player speak for the whole group, potential chaos of each player competing for the referee's attention is reduced and the game should run more smoothly, improving the play-experience for all involved. Therefore, if a caller is used, he or she should consult with the other players and then report the party's actions quickly and accurately to the referee. The caller can be anyone and need not be limited to, for instance, the character with the highest charisma or social standing. In fact, if the party uses a caller, the role should rotate among the players from session to session, giving each a turn.

## Equipment Wear & Tear

Equipment can be worn down! If you are hit by an attack where the attacker rolled a 20, your armor gains a **notch** of damage. Each notch reduces your AC total by 1. Weapons gain a notch when you roll a 1 on an attack with them. Each weapon notch reduces by one step the damage die you roll with that weapon (i.e. d10 > d8 > d6 > d4 > 1).

Items can be repaired by an appropriate craftsman, costing 10% of the item's original price per notch. Armor and weapons can take no more than 10 notches of damage before they're destroyed.

Magic weapons and armor take ½ notches instead of full notches.

## Falling

Damage from falling is determined as follows: Falls of less than 5 ft do no damage in game terms, falls of up to 10 ft cause 1d6 damage, falls of up to 20 ft cause 3d6 damage, falls of up to 30 ft cause 6d6, 40 ft is 10d6, 50 ft is 15d6, and falls of over 50 ft cause 20d6 points of damage.

## Gaining Experience & Levels

You gain experience primarily through **recovering treasure** and returning it to civilization. 1sp = 1XP.

Each new dungeon room or hex **explored and mapped** per session grants (10 * Dungeon Level) XP (or 10 * number of hexes from the nearest known settlement XP) per character.

**Philanthropy:** Donate money to the poor/church/Crown/guild/tavern to earn 1 XP per 5sp spent. A Paladin's required charity tithe does not obtain this XP.

On gaining the requisite number of experience points, a character may increase in level after completing a period of **training**. The cost of training is 1,500sp times the character's current level, and will take one day times the character's current level. For example, to advance from 2<sup>nd</sup> level to 3<sup>rd</sup> level, a character must spend 3,000sp and two days. These training requirements are replaced for Magic-Users with spell research procedures.

## Healing

A character will recover 1hp per day of uninterrupted rest. 30 days of rest will return any character to full hp.

## Hirelings & Retainers

Hirelings are unclassed zero level characters incapable of conventional advancement by level. We're using the rules & pricing for hirelings in *AD&D (OSRIC)*. Retainers are classed characters, initially of low level, but capable of level advancement, and both are available for hire by the PCs. The number of retainers available in a particular locale depends on the total population and its predisposition towards attracting adventurer types. The referee will inform you whether or not retainers can be found.

Retainers have the following rates:

- Normal human porters/torchbearers: 1sp/day or 5sp per game session. *Will not fight.*
- Retainers: 50sp on initial hire (+50sp to request a class), plus ½ share of treasure. Will be hiring PC's level plus 1-1d4 levels (i.e. somewhere between PC's level and PC's level -3).

Retainers come with a starting equipment pack. Porters/torchbearers come with no equipment. Loyalty is checked after each adventure/session. If a success is rolled, the retainer's loyalty increases by one to a maximum of 11. On a failure, the retainer departs. Equipment purchased by the PC is kept by the PC.

## Light & Vision

A party needs one light source for approximately every three members of the party. For every missing light source, PCs incur a -1 penalty to attack, up to -4. Note that light sources can be seen from much further away than the illumination they shed for those holding them. Approaching light will warn intelligent creatures of the approach of surface-dwellers, perhaps giving them a chance to prepare.

Characters who have **infravision** can see the heat that radiates off living things. Generally, living things will be visible as bright tones, while cool items are gray, and very cold objects are black. It is impossible to read in the dark with infravision; fine detail cannot be perceived. Infravision only functions in darkness and is disrupted by visible light and large heat sources.

## NPC Spellcasting

Non-player characters may be hired to cast spells or perform other services. As a rough guideline, the cost for an NPC spellcaster to perform such service is often sp equal to 10% of the XP required for a caster to attain the level needed to cast the spell (e.g. *raise dead* requires a Cleric to attain 7<sup>th</sup> level, which takes 55,000XP, so the spell would cost 5,500sp).

Sages not employed by a PC will often charge around 100sp to identify a potion, or 200sp to identify a magical item.

## Wilderness Exploration

Each day, roll 1d4, 1d6, 1d8, 1d12, 1d100.

### 1. Check for Encounters

**1d6** for encounter chance:

- City, clear, grassland, settled		1-in-6
- Air, barren, forest, hills, ocean, river, desert			2-in-6
- Jungle, mountains, swamp		3-in-6

If there's an encounter, 1d100 roll on the appropriate encounter table.

**1d8** for lair (1), tracks (2), or normal (3-8)

**1d4** for Encounter time: Morning (4a-10a), Daytime (10a-4p), Evening (4p-10p), Night (10p-4a)

### 2. Check for Lost Chance - 1d12 (1d10 in adverse conditions)

| 1d12 | Clear, Grasslands |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Veer 1 hex clockwise   |
| 2 | Veer 1 hex counterclockwise   |
| 3-12 | Not lost |

| 1d12 | Barren, Hills, Forest, Mountains |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Veer 1 hex clockwise   |
| 2 | Veer 1 hex counterclockwise   |
| 3 | Veer 2 hexes clockwise |
| 4 | Veer 2 hexes counterclockwise |
| 5-12 | Not lost |

| 1d12 | Desert, Jungle, Swamp |
|-----|--------|
| 1 | Veer 1 hex clockwise   |
| 2 | Veer 1 hex counterclockwise   |
| 3 | Veer 2 hexes clockwise |
| 4 | Veer 2 hexes counterclockwise |
| 5 | Move backwards 1 hex |
| 6 | Lose a day of travel |
| 7-12 | Not lost |

### 3. Loop: Describe surroundings  
### 4. Loop: Decide Direction

PCs have "movement points" (MP) equal to miles per day (per-turn move rate/5, in miles) divided by hex size:
| Armour | Normal | Encumbered |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Unarmored | 4 | 3 | 
| Light | 3 | 2 |
| Heavy | 2 | 1 |
*+1 MP if on a road all day*

Each hex costs a number of MP to move **into**. Clear = 1, Rough = 2, Very Rough = 3. One MP may "roll over" to the next day, and PCs may "force march" to gain 1 additional MP, but must rest the next full day.

#### Finding Hidden Features

Players may spend MP to have an X-in-Y chance of discovering any hidden features, where X is MP spent, and Y is 4 for clear terrain, 6 for rough terrain, and 8 for very rough terrain. You can spend multiple days to "guarantee" a successful exploration of a given area.

#### Hunting

Players may spend MP to have an X-in-Y chance of finding game (1d4xHD rations of food), where X is MP spent, and Y is 4 for terrain teeming with wildlife, 6 is normal, and 8 is sparsely populated. Rangers double the MP spent.

### 5. Check foraging (1-in-6), mark off supplies, mark off calendar

## Saving Throws

To make a saving throw, roll a d20. If the result is equal to or higher than the character's saving throw target number, the saving throw succeeds.

Monster Saving Throws are as follows:

| Hit Dice   | Saving Throw |
|------------|--------------|
| <1 HD      | 18           |
| 1 HD       | 17           |
| 2 HD       | 16           |
| 3 HD       | 14           |
| 4 HD       | 13           |
| 5 HD       | 12           |
| 6 HD       | 11           |
| 7 HD       | 9            |
| 8 HD       | 8            |
| 9 HD       | 6            |
| 10 HD      | 5            |
| 11 HD      | 4            |
| 12+ HD     | 3            |

## Time

Game time is measured while dungeon crawling in turns (a significant span of time roughly equal to 10 minutes). During combat, a round is 10 seconds.

# Combat

## Initiative & Order of Battle

When the party of adventurers comes into contact with enemies, the order of events is as follows:

1. **Check for Surprise:** The referee determines if a surprise roll is required, and if so, both sides roll 1d6 to see if they are surprised by the sudden encounter. On a 1 or a 2, the side is surprised.
2. **Declare Spells:** This is not an option for a group that was surprised; they have to wait until the beginning of the next round. Any character who is going to cast a spell must say so before the initiative roll. If an enemy damages the spellcaster before the spell goes off, the spell's casting is disturbed and the spell is lost. As the round proceeds, the spell caster may elect not to cast the spell without losing it, but may not substitute another action. A Fighter parrying or Cleric or Paladin turning undead must declare it during this phase.
3. **Determine Initiative:** Each side rolls a d6 and the side with the highest result is the winner. One roll is made for each side, not for each individual. If this is the first round and one group was surprised, the other side gets to go first automatically, without having to roll a die. Ties are re-rolled.
4. **Movement and Missile Fire:** Each combatant on the side that won initiative may move, and may fire any missile weapons. Then the losers of the initiative roll may move or fire missile weapons. Darts may fire a second time at the end of this phase. *Note: A Fighter making multiple melee attacks may make their first attack immediately after moving.*
5. **Melee Combat and Spells:** Each combatant on the side that won initiative makes any melee attacks (if in melee range) or casts spells. Spells take effect immediately. Losers of the initiative then make their attacks and cast spells.
6. **The round is complete.** Any remaining attacks are resolved (Fighters, bows, darts, etc.). Repeat from step 2 (Declare Spells) until combat is complete.

## Damage & Death

When a character is hit, the amount of damage is deducted from their hit points. When hit points reach 0, the character is unconscious and must make a saving throw. On a failure, the character dies. On a success, the character will die in 1d4 rounds, rolled in secret by the referee, unless magically healed or aided by another player character. Each PC may attempt to aid once, succeeding on a 1-in-6 chance.

Even after returning to 1 or more hp, the character will remain in a coma for 1d6 turns and must rest for a minimum of one week before resuming any sort of strenuous activity, mental or physical.

Characters who are slain may be raised from the dead if a Cleric of sufficient level is available to perform the casting.

## Attacking from Behind

Any attack made from behind has a to-hit bonus of +2, or +4 if made by a Thief or Assassin. There are only two ways for most people to get behind someone during combat. One is to surprise an opponent and attack from behind during the surprise action. The other is to attack an opponent from behind when an ally is attacking from the front. Thieves and Assassins can get behind a target during normal combat if they successfully hide in shadows, even if no one is attacking the target from the front.

## Cover

Cover is protection behind something that can block incoming attacks, such as a wall or arrow slit. Cover bonuses are as follows: 25% cover: +1 AC; 50% cover: +2 AC; 75% cover: +3 AC; 90% cover: +4 AC. Firing into a melee is considered 50% cover if firing past a dwarf or halfling, and 90% cover if firing past a human, elf, or half-elf.

## Grappling

The attackers (or attacker) make individual to-hit rolls. The grapple is resolved among those who hit: Each combatant rolls their total hit dice. If the sum of the attackers' dice is higher than the defender's total, the defender is completely pinned and can be killed in the next round unless help arrives or the defender wins initiative and breaks loose. If the sums are exactly equal, everyone is struggling, and none of them can attack with a weapon. If the defender wins, the attackers are beaten back and stunned for a number of rounds equal to the number of points by which the defender beat them. Breaking free of a grapple requires another HD contest.

## Invisible Opponents

Attacks against an invisible opponent have a -4 penalty. Powerful magical monsters, or monsters with more than 11 hit dice, will usually be able to see invisible creatures normally.

## Morale

Certain monsters, such as mindless or undead creatures, are fearless and always fight to the death. The majority, however, will not continue to fight a hopeless battle; they will seek to retreat, flee, or surrender. Morale checks are made when a side loses its first casualty and again when they lose half their number in combat to death or incapacitation. Creatures make morale checks individually, not as an entire side.

## Movement Within Melee

A defender effectively blocks an area about five feet across, and enemies cannot move through this area without first killing the defender. A character in melee (within 5') can make a fighting withdrawal, moving backwards at up to half their encounter movement rate. There must be a clear path for this movement. A character in melee can also make a full retreat, turning and fleeing from melee, moving up to their full encounter movement rate. The character may not attack this round; the opponent gains a +2 bonus to all attacks against the character and ignores any shield AC bonus.

## Prone or Stunned Opponent

Attacks against a prone or stunned opponent negate the shield & Dex bonuses, and are made at +4 to hit.

## Spacing & the Second Rank

Only shortswords, spears, and polearms can be used three-abreast in a 10' area. All other one-handed weapons require five feet of room (two-abreast in a 10' area), and non-thrusting two-handed weapons require a full 10' space to wield. Spears and polearms in the second rank of a battle formation can attack by reaching through the first rank.

## Subdual Damage

A weapon may be used to beat down, rather than kill, an opponent. Players must announce the intention to deal subdual damage before attacking, and all damage done to an opponent the players wish to subdue must be subdual damage (not lethal). Not all weapons can deal subdual damage. Subdual damage does not kill, and such points are recovered at a rate of 1hp/hour.

## Two-Handed Weapons & Two-Weapon Fighting

Just as shields improve armor class by 1, fighting two-handed grants a +1 to damage rolls (except for weapons that can only be used two-handed, where this is already taken into account in the weapon's damage), and fighting with a weapon in each hand gives a +1 to hit. (Note that fighting with two weapons does not actually give two separate attacks; it just increases the likelihood of landing a successful blow.)

## Life Energy Levels & Level Drain

Certain monsters, magic items and spells have the power to drain "life energy levels," perform a "level drain," or an "energy drain." If a PC is drained of a life energy level, he or she loses one complete level of experience and is placed at the beginning point of the new level. The appropriate hit die is rolled and subtracted from the PC's current hp.

If the character is multi-classed or dual-classed, then the highest level of experience attained by that character is lost. If the character has two equal levels, then the level lost should be determined randomly. A PC drained below level 1 is slain (and may rise as some kind of undead creature). NPCs lose a level or hit die, as applicable.

# Multi-Classing & Dual-Classing

## Multi-classing

Multi-classing, which is an option available only to non-human characters, is simultaneous advancement from 1st level in two or more different classes. Multi-class characters begin with a single hit die. Each multi-class hit die is calculated by rolling the appropriate die for each class, adding any Constitution modifier, and averaging the result. A multi-classed character is limited to a total of 9 hit dice no matter what combination of classes is used. After reaching 9 HD, the character gains only 1 hit point per additional level.

A multi-classed character acts with the abilities of both (or all three) classes at once, and is subject to all the limitations of each class at once. The more restrictive of any two class requirements applies to multi-classed Dwarves. The less restrictive of any two class requirements applies to multi-classed Elves and Half-Elves. However, Cleric/Fighters may use edged weapons, and elven Fighter/Magic-Users may cast arcane spells while armored. Wearing armor other than padded or leather while attempting Thief skills incurs a penalty equal to the number of slots the armor takes.

Any experience points received are divided evenly among all the classes of a multi-classed character and tracked separately, even when the character can no longer advance in one or more classes. Multi-classed characters do not receive bonuses to experience points, regardless of their Attribute scores.

The saving throw of a multi-classed character is the best available from the different choices, including any bonuses from a character class.

The abilities of a class are gained as soon as a new level is achieved in that class, but a new hit die is not gained until the character has advanced a level in all classes. In other words, a dwarven Fighter/Thief would not gain a "Thief" hit die at level 1/2; instead, the character would receive a second multi-class hit die (the averaged result of the roll of a d10 and a d4) after reaching 2nd level as a Fighter also.

If a multi-classed character reaches the point where one class is "capped," and the character cannot advance in that class any more, the character still gains only a new hit die when both (or all three) levels would have been reached.

## Dual Classing

Dual-classed characters are humans who elect to change irrevocably from one class to another. Humans are more flexible and can generally become more skilled in any one class than non-humans, but lacking the innate talents of the other races, they can only focus upon one class at a time.

In order to change class, the character must have a minimum attribute score of 16 in the Prime Attribute of the new class, and must qualify in terms of normal ability score requirements and alignment restrictions.

The character retains his or her hit points. He or she can use the particular abilities of the original class, but doing so will cause the character to forfeit all experience points from that adventure (as determined by the referee). This restriction applies until the character has advanced in the new class to a level at least one higher than was attained in the original class.

When the character begins the process of learning a new class, he or she gains the abilities of the new class as a first level member of that class, and all experience is applied to progressing in the new class. The character gains no additional hit points until reaching a level in the new class one higher than in the original class, after which time the character's hit points advance as per the new class. A character can never gain more than 9 full hit dice, no matter how many total levels are gained.

Unlike multi-class characters, dual-classed characters cannot perform the functions of several different classes simultaneously. So, for example, an elven Fighter/Magic-User could cast arcane spells while wearing armor, but a human dual-classed Fighter and Magic-User would have to remove his or her armor to do the same thing.

# Classes

## Cleric

Clerics are armored warrior-priests (or -priestesses) who serve Law or Chaos. Most Clerics have a patron deity or serve a particular religion, although the unified power of Law is paramount for Lawful Clerics and has an existence in and of itself. You are a champion of your faith and moral alignment. You might be a shining knight of the faith, an exorcist of demons, or a sinister witch-hunter. Because most of a Cleric's abilities are oriented toward healing and protecting, Clerics tend to play a support role during combat: backing up the front line, but able to stand shoulder to shoulder with the party's Fighters if the need arises at least for a while. As your Cleric grows in power and reputation, the character might establish a stronghold for the faith: a fortified monastery, a soaring cathedral in the wilderness, or whatever strikes the Cleric as the best way to protect and serve a growing flock of acolytes and loyal peasant followers.

> **Prime Attribute**: Wisdom, 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
> 
> **Hit Dice**: 1d8/level (Gains 2 hp/level after 9th level)
>
> **Alignment**: Lawful or Chaotic
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: Any
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Blunt weapons only (club, flail, hammer, mace, staff, etc.). No missile weapons other than oil or slings.
>
> **Race**: Dwarves, Elves, Half-elves, and Humans may be Clerics.

**Saving Throw Bonus:** Clerics gain a +2 bonus on saving throw rolls against being paralyzed or poisoned.

**Spell Casting:** Clerics cast "divine" spells from a specific list, with numbers as per the Cleric Level Advancement table. Clerics of specific deities might have different lists of available spells, as designed by the referee. Each day, the Cleric selects and prays for a particular set of spells, choosing any spells from the standard list. Once a spell is cast, it cannot be cast again until the next day unless the Cleric prepares (prays for) the spell more than once.

**Turning Undead:** Clerics can "turn" the undead, making them flee from the Cleric's holiness (or, in the case of an evil Cleric, bringing them to heel as servants and minions). The Cleric must hold their holy symbol and roll 1d20 on the Turn Undead Table. If the result is equal to or higher than the number shown, the attempt is successful and the creatures flee for 3d4 rounds, moving away from the Cleric as fast as possible. They will attack a creature directly blocking its escape route, but otherwise may not fight. Normally 2d6 creatures are affected by Turn Undead. Exceptions are Paladins and Type 13 creatures, of which only 1d2 are affected, and results of "D", which affect 1d6+6 creatures.

**Religious Stronghold (9th level):** At ninth level, a Cleric character may establish a stronghold and attract a body of men-at-arms who swear fealty to the character as loyal (or perhaps even fanatical) soldiers and retainers.

## Druid

Druids are part of a mysterious religious order of priests and priestesses who worship and serve the powers of nature. As a Druid, you have great reverence for the natural world, and are more comfortable with plants and animals than with other people. You can cast spells to talk with wildlife, or enlist animals and even plants as your allies, but you are also an able fighter in defense of your forest and your friends. You share some characteristics with Fighters, Clerics, and Magic-Users, but you are not as strong as those classes in their own specialties. However, you are better in physical combat than a Magic-User, while still having some healing ability and offensive spell power. Some of your nature spells are unlike anything a Cleric or Magic-User can cast. You are ready to extend the balance of nature to human affairs and have little tolerance for those who go to excess either for good or evil, Law or Chaos. You keep your rituals secret and prefer to live in the wilderness rather than in cities. Your ability to control fire helps to protect your sacred groves, but also can be effective in battle. One day, when you gain all your powers, you might choose to leave the life of adventuring and retreat to the ancient forests, never to be seen again. Or you might choose to establish a Druidic citadel in a forest or around a newly-raised henge of stones. The decision is yours.

> **Prime Attribute**: Wisdom *and* Charisma, both 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
>
> **Hit Dice**: 1d8/level (Max level 14)
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: Leather armor, wooden shield.
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Club, dagger, dart, hammer, sickle-shaped shortsword, spear, sling, staff, oil.
>
> **Race**: Halflings and Humans may be Druids.

**Magic Items**: Druids are able to use any magical item Clerics can, with the exception of Clerical spell scrolls.

**Mistletoe**: Rather than using a holy symbol as Clerics do, Druids require mistletoe, holly, or (if neither can be found) oak leaves to cast their spells. A Druid can barely cast spells at all without the mystical or symbolic connection provided by the mistletoe sprig. The connection of a Druid to nature is not the same as the Cleric's connection to a divine being; it is inherently more inchoate, less focused, and more diverse. Although Druids are considered a sub-class of Clerics, their magic bears some partial similarities to that of Magic Users: they require more of a symbolic focus and rely to a greater degree on learning and lore than upon the faith, devotional, and crusading aspects that are so crucial to the power of a true Cleric of Law or Chaos.

**Saving Throw Bonus**: Druids gain a +2 bonus on saving throw rolls against fire & lightning.

**Secret Language**: The Druidic hierarchy speaks a secret language known to all true (Neutral) Druids.

**Spell Casting**: Druids cast spells from a specific list, with numbers as per the Druid Level Advancement table. Each day, the Druid selects and prays for a particular set of spells, choosing any spells from the standard Druid spell list. Once a spell is cast, it cannot be cast again until the next day, unless the Druid prepares (prays for) the spell more than once.

**Druid's Knowledge (3rd):** At 3rd level, a Druid can identify plant and animal types, and can determine when water is pure and safe to drink.

**Wilderness Movement (3rd):** At third level and higher, a Druid can move through any natural undergrowth leaving no trace of his or her passage, and may do so with no reduction in his or her normal movement speed.

**Immunity to Fey Charms (7th):** At 7th level, the Druid becomes completely immune to the charms of dryads, naiads, satyrs, and other such fey creatures of the wild woods and rivers.

**Shape Change (7th):** Also at 7th level, the Druid can change shape into the form of an animal up to three times per day. The form assumed must be a natural animal, no smaller than a mouse, and no larger than double the Druid's normal weight. The Druid can change into as many as three different animal forms per day --- one from each category of reptile, mammal, and bird but only once for each form within a single day. When the Druid shapeshifts, 1d6 x 10 percent of any lost hit points are cured.

**Druidic Stronghold (11th):** Upon reaching 11th level, a Druid may build a stronghold in the wilderness, usually made up of a stone circle and/or other megaliths, one or more groves, and a fortress redoubt of some kind to protect the area. Such isolated strongholds often serve as informal academies for aspirant Druids in-training, or as fortresses sited to defend wilderness areas threatened by Law or Chaos. A Druid who establishes such a stronghold gathers supporters and followers, although many of these will not be human.

**Druidic Hierarchy:** There can only be a certain number of high-level Druids in the world. The limits are: 12th level Druid (High Druid)---no more than 3 in the world at any one time; 13th level Druid (Archdruid)---no more than 2 in the world at any given time; only one 14th level Druid (Supreme Druid) can exist. If a Druid receives so many experience points that he or she is eligible to increase to these levels, but all the vacant slots are already filled, then he or she must create a vacancy. This is done by issuing a formal challenge to the Druid in question, following which the two characters must compete in a contest of some kind---often, but not necessarily, a duel. The loser of the contest goes down to the next lowest level (losing all experience down to the very minimum to qualify for the new level). This may, in turn, result in a further contest if the preceding level is also fully occupied.

A Druid who has lost a challenge, regained the necessary experience to make another, and then declines to make that challenge, becomes an outcast. Such Druids can continue to advance in levels, but those who forgo the challenges and strike out on their own path are forever separated from the protection, assistance, and community of the Druidic hierarchy. They are considered, for all intents and purposes, to be renegades.

**14th level is the ceiling for Druids. Any further experience points past 1,500,000 the Druid receives will be lost.*

## Fighter

You are a warrior trained in battle and in the use of armor and weapons. Perhaps you are a ferocious Viking raider, a roaming samurai, a dashing swashbuckler, a deadly swordswoman, or a chivalrous knight. Whatever type of Fighter you choose to play, you will probably end up on the front lines of your adventuring party---going toe-to-toe with dragons, goblins, and evil cultists, hacking your way through them and taking the brunt of their attacks. The Fighter character is the best-equipped of all the character classes to dish out damage and absorb it, too. Clerics heal and Magic-Users cast spells, but the down-and-dirty, hack-and-slash work is generally up to you.

Most Fighters look forward to the day when their reputations will bring them into the ranks of the lesser nobility, where fighting prowess and armed followers are more important than high-flown bloodlines. It is no small matter to carve a freehold out of the wilderness, but to do so is to leave behind a legacy in a world where most fortune-seekers die an unsung death. A Fighter of 9th level or higher who has built a castle and cleared a wide area around it of monsters (at least a 20 mile radius), will attract a body of mercenaries to his or her service, provided that these are paid a fair wage. He or she will also be able to tax each freeholder, at up to the maximum rate of 1 sp per month per resident. Some players may choose to retire a character at this point, satisfied that the character has entered the historical records and legends of the campaign world. Others may choose to view the stronghold merely as the first step toward the pinnacles of mythic power. Such player-held castles and villages provide a higher-level party with a base for adventures, a stronghold against enemies, and possibly the introduction of feudal politics and war into their already-eventful lives.

> **Prime Attribute**: Strength, 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
>
>  **Hit Dice**: 1d10/level (Gain 3hp/level after 9th level)
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: Any
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Any
>
> **Race**: Any

**Bonus Attacks:** Fighters with melee weapons attack once per round at 1st to 6th levels (1/1 attacks); at 7th to 12th levels, they attack thrice every two rounds (3/2 attacks); and at 13th or higher levels they attack twice per round (2/1 attacks). A partial additional attack (e.g. 3/2 attacks) means that the extra attack is taken on odd-numbered rounds in the combat sequence, hence two attacks on the first round, one on the second, two on the third and one on the fourth, if applicable.

**Fighting the Unskilled**: Against creatures with 1 (8-sided) hit die or less, a Fighter makes one attack per level each round. A Fighter exercising multiple attacks departs from the normal initiative procedure. The Fighter will automatically attack first in the round unless fighting an opponent with multiple attacks of its own (in which case initiative should be rolled as normal). The Fighter's second attack in any given melee round will come in their usual place, and any further attacks will come last in the sequence.

**Saving Throw Bonus**: Fighters have a +1 bonus on all saving throws except against spells (including those from wands and staffs).

**Strength Bonuses**: Unlike most other character classes, Fighters with a high Strength can have bonuses to hit and on damage.

 **Parry**: Fighters with a Dexterity score of 14 or better can fight on the defensive, parrying enemy blows and dodging attacks instead of attacking, as shown on the table below.

| Dexterity Score | Penalty to Enemy Attacks |
|-----------------|--------------------------|
| 14-15           |  -1 |
| 16-17           | -2 |
| 18              |  -3 |

**Establish Stronghold (9th)**: At 9th level, a Fighter may establish a stronghold and attract a body of men-at-arms who swear their loyalty to the character as their liege lord (or lady). Most likely, the castle attracts peasants seeking safe places to establish homes, and the Fighter becomes more powerful and influential as the number of such followers increases. The stronghold will likely be a small territory carved from the wilderness, held as a freehold by the self-ennobled character.

**Constitution hp adjustments no longer apply. Each level gained thereafter requires 250,000 XP and grants +3 hp.*

Note: If a Fighter of extremely high level or with many bonuses "to hit" actually requires a negative roll to hit his or her target, the negative number needed may be converted to a positive and applied as additional damage to the automatic hit. Thus, for example, a 20th level Fighter with 18 strength and a +5 sword has a total to-hit bonus of +26. Against an AC 18 dragon, this would be an automatic hit *plus* 8 additional damage (26 to-hit -- AC 18).

## Magic-User

As a Magic-User, you are a figure of mystery and a student of mysteries, steeped in ancient and arcane knowledge. You have studied long hours deep into the candlelit nights, delving into the parchment pages of cobweb-covered magic tomes, learning the intricacies of magical circles and runes, the strange significances of the stars and moons, the disquieting theories of mad philosophers, and above all, the casting of magic spells. You can be a truly devastating opponent as long as your fellow adventurers protect you from physical combat, in which you are the weakest of all the character classes: completely untrained in the use of armor, barely adequate with even the simplest weapons, and having fewer hit points than most other members of an adventuring expedition. You are not limited to the role of providing the party with offensive spells, though, for your spellbook provides an array of other spells that can be critical for surviving the perils of dungeons, lost temples, and other such places where you might venture in search of treasure and knowledge. If you succeed in such forays into the wild and dangerous places of the world, you might eventually rise to such heights of power that you can build a mystically protected tower for your researches and create fabulous magic items. Such great Archmages can sway the politics of kingdoms, commanding respect and fear across the realms.

> **Prime Attribute**: Intelligence, 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
>
> **Hit Dice**: 1d4/level (Gains 1hp/level after 11th level)
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: None
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Dagger, staff, and darts.
>
> **Race**: Elves, Half-elves, and Humans may be Magic-Users

**Acquiring New Spells**: A Magic-User will automatically receive one new spell of the highest level he or she may cast when reaching a new level of spell (i.e. upon reaching 3rd level, the Magic-User will automatically receive one 2nd-level spell; upon reaching 5th level, one 3rd-level spell). The rest must be found and copied into the mage's spellbook from dungeons or musty libraries in the world, or painstakingly researched.

To copy a spell from a scroll (or spellbook), the mage must first be able to read the spell (i.e. by casting *read magic*). If the mage understands the spell (see table below), he or she may then transcribe the spell into his or her own spellbook, which takes 1 hour per level of the spell. If the spell is on a scroll, this process always erases the scroll. If the roll to understand the spell fails, the Magic-User may attempt to understand it again if a) they gain a level, or b) they come across a different instance of the spell.

To research a new spell, the player should describe in detail the spell they wish to create and the effects it has. The referee will then decide if the spell can be created and, if so, what the spell level will be. The spells in *OSRIC* are "pre-approved" and have been invented in the world already. To research, the Magic-User must spend two weeks and 2,000sp per level of the spell. If the research fails (see the table), the money and time invested are lost. Future attempts require half the money and time investment (i.e. 2nd try: 1 week+ 1,000sp per spell level, 3rd try: 3 days+500sp, etc.).

| Intelligence Score | Chance to Understand Spells | Chance of Successful Research |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------------|

**Creating Magical Items:** Magic-Users can create spell scrolls at any level, potions at 9th level, and magic items at 11th level. See "Magic & Spells" later for details and costs.

**Saving Throw Bonus:** Magic-Users gain a bonus of +2 on all saving throw rolls against spells, including spells from magic wands and staffs.

**Spell Casting:** A Magic-User owns a book of spells, which does not necessarily include all of the spells on the standard lists. Reading from this book, Magic-Users force selected spell formulae into their minds, "preparing" as many spells as the Magic-User can mentally sustain. (It is possible to prepare a spell multiple times using the available "slots" in the Magic-User's memory and mental capability.) Once a prepared spell is cast, it disappears from the Magic-User's ability to cast, until it is prepared again. Magic-Users may also cast spells from arcane magical scrolls, which consumes that portion of the scroll.

**Understanding Spells:** A Magic-User can understand a limited number of spells per level, based on his or her Intelligence score (see Character Creation pages). For example, a Magic-User of 3rd level with an Intelligence of 14 can understand and have in his or her spellbook a maximum of 24 spells in total.

**Wizard's Tower (11th):** At 11th level, a Magic-User gains the title of "Wizard" and can build a stronghold to contain the necessary libraries and laboratories of a high-level mage. Such a powerful sorcerer attracts a mixed bag of mercenaries, strange servants (some with odd abilities and deformities), and perhaps even a few monsters. This colorful crew swears fealty and serves the wizard with considerable (but not unlimited) loyalty. In general, such a freehold will encompass a small territory around the tower as well---whatever quantity of wilderness the Magic-User chooses to tame and protect.

## Paladin

As a Paladin, you are a resolute warrior against Chaos and evil, and a stalwart defender of Law. You might resemble the "knight in shining armor," or you might be a grim, deadly veteran of the dark and desperate war against the foul powers of Chaos. In either case, you are wholly dedicated to the eradication of Chaos and the protection of civilization. You defend the weak from tyranny, fight injustice where you find it, and hunt down those who are tainted with the demonic mark of Chaos. Most Paladins are members of an order of knights or are attached to the service of a temple of Law, although some of them operate as "knights errant" following the guidance of higher powers toward the places where Law battles Chaos.

> **Prime Attribute**: Strength, 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
>
>  **Hit Dice**: 1d8/level (Gains 2hp/level after 9th level)
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: Any
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Any
>
> **Race**: Only Humans may be Paladins.

**Alignment:** A Paladin is a paragon of righteousness sworn to be, and always to remain, Lawful. If this vow is ever breached, the Paladin must atone and perform penance to be decided by a powerful Lawful NPC Cleric---unless the breach was intentional, in which case the Paladin instantly loses his or her enhanced status as a Paladin and may never regain it. Such a "fallen Paladin" is in all respects a Fighter, with no special powers, forever.

**Cure Disease:** Paladins can cure disease (as the clerical spell) by touch, once per week. Paladins of higher than 5th level may do so twice per week, and those higher than 10th level thrice per week. Paladins themselves are completely immune to disease.

**Divine Favor:** Although Paladins do not receive a class-based saving throw bonus, they have better saving throw chances than any other character class due to the divine influence of Law.

**Detect Evil:** A Paladin may detect evil at any range up to 60 ft at will, if he or she concentrates on doing so in the right general direction.

**Protection from Evil:** A Paladin radiates an aura within a 10' radius, equivalent to the clerical spell *protection from evil*.

**Lay on Hands:** A Paladin can "lay on hands" once per day to cure the touched creature 2hp per Paladin level.

**Paladin Vows:** See Alignment, above. Also, Paladins may own 1 suit of magic armor, 1 magic shield, and up to 3 magic weapons, but no more than 4 additional magic items. Paladins must give away 10% of any treasure received to some Lawful Good cause, and if any remains after paying costs (like maintaining equipment or paying servants' wages or constructing a small castle), that surplus must likewise be donated. Paladins will not associate with characters who are not Lawful save under very exceptional circumstances.

**Turn Undead (3rd):** Paladins of 3rd level and higher gain the ability to turn undead as a Lawful Cleric does, but as a Cleric of two levels lower than the Paladin's level (see table, next page).

**Summon Warhorse (4th):** At 4th level, once every ten years, the Paladin may summon a special Paladin's Warhorse, a heavy warhorse with enhanced hit points, intelligence and movement speed.

**Bonus Attacks (8th):** Paladins gain additional attacks as Fighters do, but less swiftly. A Paladin has one attack at 1<sup>st</sup> to 7th level, 3/2 attacks at 8th to 14th level, and two attacks at 15th level and above.

**Clerical Spellcasting (9th):** Paladins gain the ability to cast certain Cleric spells at 9th level (see table, below).

## Ranger

You and your fellow Rangers are the inheritors of ancient scholarship, students of forgotten skills and lore passed on from teacher to student over the generations. The Rangers retreated to the wilderness long ago; they seldom visit the decadent, glittering cities, for these are places that have turned aside from much of the lore the Rangers protect. As a Ranger, you are well versed in the subtlety of the wilderness, and you are a dangerous opponent in battle. When you reach higher level, your studies and understanding of ancient lore will have developed to the point where you can even cast spells. You are a guardian of civilization and a protector of the weak, hunting the creatures of chaos in the wild places where they lurk. You take the battle directly to the enemy, in its very lair.

> **Prime Attribute**: Strength, 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
>
>  **Hit Dice**: 2d8 at 1st level, 1d8/level thereafter (Gains 2hp/level after 9th level)
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: Any
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Any
>
> **Race**: Only Humans may be Rangers.

**Alertness:** Rangers are less likely to be surprised (1-in-6), and more likely to surprise others (3-in-6) than other character classes.

**Alignment:** Rangers must be, and remain, Lawful in alignment, or they lose all Ranger abilities and are treated as ordinary Fighters.

**Damage Bonus vs Humanoids:** Rangers receive a +1 to melee damage per Ranger level against evil humanoid or giantish opponents (including such creatures as orcs, goblins, and giants, for example). Thus, a 3rd level Ranger would receive +3 damage per hit against these creatures.

**Lone Ranger:** Until 8th Level & the title "Ranger Knight," a Ranger may not hire or accept followers of any kind. A maximum of three Rangers may travel or operate together at any one time. Rangers travel light and may not keep more treasure than they (or their steed) can carry.

**Magic Items:** Rangers can use any magic items that can normally be used by Fighters.

**Tracking:** Rangers are able to track down other creatures in the wild, in cities, and even underground.

- Outdoor Tracking: Outdoors, the basic chance for successful tracking (on a day-to-day basis) is 90%, modified by a --10% for each day old the tracks are, and modified by --10% (for the entire effort thereafter) for each day of rain (or snow) that has fallen on the trail.
- Underground and City Tracking: Tracking in the city (any urban or populated area) or underground, makes it considerably harder to find and follow a trail. First, the beginning of the trail must be no more than an hour old. The base chance to track is 65%, and each time the trail changes (as described below), there is a chance for the Ranger to lose the trail and be unable to track it further.

  | Trail Change                           | Chance to Lose Trail |
  |-------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
  | Turns down a side passage:                              | 25% chance to lose trail |
  | Goes through a door:                                    | 35% chance to lose trail |
  | Goes up or down through a trapdoor or ladder:           | 40% chance to lose trail |
  | Climbs a wall up or down (including pits and shafts):   | 50% chance to lose trail |

**Bonus Attacks (8th):** Rangers gain additional attacks as Fighters do, but less swiftly. A Ranger has one attack at 1^st^ to 7th level, 3/2 attacks at 8th to 14th level, and two attacks at 15th and above.

**Spell Casting (8th):** At eighth level, Rangers receive limited spell powers, drawn from the Druid and Magic-User spell lists according to the table given hereafter.

**Fortress (9th):** Rangers of 9th level or higher may build a fortress in the wilderness to house the character's growing number of loyal retainers & followers. When the fortress is completed, the Ranger's reputation draws a number of new followers, as well as peasants seeking a safe place to settle. Roll 2d12 to determine the number of followers. Determine the class of each in this order: half of the total will be Fighters, a quarter of them will be Clerics, one-fifth of them will be Magic-Users, and if there are more than 20 followers, one of them will be a Neutral-aligned Thief. The followers will be at least second level; for each there is a 25% chance to add 1d4 to the base second level. Also, for each of these followers, there is a 2% chance that the follower is actually a highly unusual type instead of whatever the dice originally indicated. Roll 1d6 on the table below to determine the type:

-   1-2 = Another Ranger (level 1d6+1)
-   3-4 = A lycanthrope (werebear or wereboar)
-   5 = A mated pair of unicorns
-   6 = A pegasus

**Scrying Device Use (10th):** Rangers of 10th level or higher may use crystal balls and other such devices that permit magical scrying.

## Thief

You are a figure in the shadows, an expert in stealth and delicate tasks. Locks, traps, and scouting are your trade; you are the eyes and ears of the adventuring party, the one who handles the perils of the dungeon itself. In many ways, you are a scholar of the world; in the course of your profession you pick up knowledge about languages and even magic. True, in combat you are not the equal of armored Fighters or Clerics, but they rely on your knowledge and specialized skills to get them safely into and out of the dangerous places where treasure is to be found. You are the guide; the scout; and when necessary, the deadly blade that strikes from the shadows without warning. In your profession, it takes great skill to survive—the life expectancy of most Thieves is very short. However, if you rise to high level, your reputation in the hidden community of tomb robbers and alley skulkers will attract followers to your side, often enough allies to place you in power as a guildmaster of Thieves. A high-level Thief is a deadly opponent, for such an individual has learned subtlety and survival in the game's most difficult profession.

> **Prime Attribute**: Dexterity, 13+ (+5% experience bonus)
>
>  **Hit Dice**: 1d6/level (Gains 2hp/level after 10th level)
>
> **Armor/Shield Permitted**: Padded, leather, fur armor; no shield.
>
> **Weapons Permitted**: Any, but magical weapons are limited to daggers and swords.
>
> **Race**: Any

**Alignment:** Thieves must be of Neutral or Chaotic alignment.

**Backstab:** When attacking with surprise, from behind, with a melee weapon, the attack is made at +4 to hit and inflicts double damage. At levels 6-8, damage is tripled; at levels 9-12, damage is quadrupled; at level 13+, damage is quintupled. Damage modifiers (such as those pertaining to strength or magic) are not multiplied.

**Saving Throw Bonus:** Thieves gain a +2 bonus on saving throws against devices, including traps, magical wands or staffs, and other magical devices.

**Thieves' Cant:** Thieves have their own language.

**Thieves' Guild (9th):** At 9th level, a Thief is well known enough to assemble a small guild of Thieves, attracting a shadowy band of sneaks, thugs, and other unsavory characters into his or her service. Thieves' guilds tend to be fronts for illicit or questionable activity regardless of alignment. Thieves usually attract a gang of followers appropriate to their alignment who are generally loyal, but not particularly devoted.

**Use Scrolls (10th):** At 10th level, Thieves can use magical and clerical scrolls. However, this casting is not always successful. The Thief should roll against his or her intelligence as a Magic-User to understand the scroll, and if the score shown on the die is insufficient for the Thief to cast the spell, then the casting will fail, likely having some entirely unexpected effect.

**Thieving Skills:** Thieves are preternaturally good at certain skills. Roll the number listed or lower on a 1d20 to succeed. Add your Dex mod to * skills. At 1st level, you have 12 points to distribute among your skills (no more than 6 to one single skill). At each level, you gain an additional 6 points to distribute (no more than 3 to a single skill each level). No skill can be raised above 19, including adjustments for dexterity, race, and armor. The referee will always roll Move Silently, Hide in Shadows, and Detect Noise checks. The starting values are as follows:

-   \*Pick Pockets: 3
-   \*Open Locks: 2
-   \*Find/Remove Traps: 1
-   \*Move Silently: 2
-   \*Hide in Shadows: 1
-   Climb Walls: 12
-   Detect Noise: 3
-   Read Languages: 0

> -   **Pick Pockets:** If the Thief's pick pockets check fails by 4 or more, then his or her attempt has been discovered and the intended victim will almost always take hostile action.
> -   **Open Locks:** Thieves can pick any mechanical locking mechanism requiring keys and/or finesse to unlock. Picking a lock takes 1 turn. Failure indicates the attempt is impossible until the Thief increases in experience level. Picking locks requires suitable tools. Improvised tools and stressful or awkward positions apply penalties as set by the referee.
> -   **Find/Remove Traps:** Thieves' expertise with small, complex mechanisms allows them to find and remove treasure traps or other small traps with accessible mechanics. Other classes do not have the expertise to attempt this feat. On a dice roll of 20 the trap is automatically sprung. Removing or disarming a trap requires suitable tools. Improvised tools and stressful or awkward positions apply penalties as set by the referee. Thieves can detect and remove magical traps, but the chance of success is halved. PCs of all classes may try to find or remove any trap by describing their actions (e.g. poking a dagger in a lock, pouring water over a floor, etc.). In this way, it is possible to find, bypass, or disable traps without a roll.
> -   **Move Silently:** Thieves have the skill to move *completely* *silently*. A Thief who fails their roll to move silently is still assumed to be moving quietly; thus, the normal surprise rules apply.
> -   **Hide in Shadows:** Some shadow must be present for this ability to be used, but if the check is successful the Thief is effectively invisible until he makes an attack or moves from the shadows. The ability can also be used to blend in with a crowd of people rather than disappear into shadows. Infravision does not reveal a hidden Thief.
> -   **Climb Walls:** A Thief can scale sheer walls and surfaces without any gear, cling to ceilings, and perform other feats of climbing that would normally be impossible. The check is normally repeated every 10 feet.
> -   **Detect Noise:** Replaces Listening at Doors and its base 1-in-6 chance (2-in-6 chance for elves & halflings).
> -   **Read Languages:** The Thief may attempt to read languages and ciphers of a non-magical nature only.
> -   **Read Languages:** The Thief may attempt to read languages and ciphers of a non-magical nature only.

# Magic & Spells

## Creating Magic Items

Potions are created by alchemists, with the more powerful potions usually requiring the help of a Magic-User. A Magic-User seeking to create potions must employ an alchemist. A Magic-User must be 9th level to create potions on their own, and 11th level to create other magic items.

## Memorizing Spells

Spell memorization requires a minimum rest period of 4 hours, which must be spent in a quiet place without interruption. Once this period has expired, it takes fifteen minutes per level to memorize spells; in other words, a character memorizing one 3rd, two 2nd and four 1st level spells would require a further (45+30+30+15+15+15+15=) two hours and forty-five minutes of memorization time. Spells, once cast, are lost from the casting character's memory and cannot be reused until the caster memorizes them again. (Exception: It is possible to memorize the same spell twice or even more times if the caster has sufficient spell slots.)

## Scribing Scrolls

Scrolls may be created by Clerics or Magic-Users at a cost of 500sp per level of the spell, and require a full week of work for each spell level. Magically-infused inks brewed by alchemists are the main component of this cost, and these may not be readily available outside large cities. A character cannot scribe a scroll based off another scroll.

## Spell Scrolls

It is not possible to memorize a spell from a scroll, although magic users may copy the spell from the scroll into their spell books, if they understand the spell. This process always erases the scroll. This is the primary means by which magic users will acquire new spells for their spell books.

Alternatively, the spell may be cast directly from the scroll, in which case the scroll is erased as the spell is cast. In this case, it is not necessary for the caster to know the spell beforehand, and indeed it is possible to cast a spell from a scroll even if the caster does not know the spell or is of insufficient level to use the magic.

In extreme cases (such as when a character casts a spell from a scroll well above the level he or she could normally memorize) the referee will assign a chance that the spell will fail.

A character must be of the correct class to cast a spell from a scroll. Thus, only Clerics or Paladins may cast spells from clerical scrolls, only Druids or Rangers from druidic ones, and so on. (Exception: Thieves may attempt to cast arcane and phantasmal spells from scrolls.)

## Spell Lists
